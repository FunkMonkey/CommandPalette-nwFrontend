The Mighty Command Palette
==========================

Contributing
------------

This repository contains the node-webkit based frontend. It depends on the backend.

The app uses two npm packages / git repositories, thus setting up the development environment is a little more complicated.

Do the following:
```
TODO
```

Now you have both repositories setup properly. Don't forget to commit and push both.
